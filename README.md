# Sample Snack app

Open the `App.js` file to start writing some code. You can preview the changes directly on your phone or tablet by scanning the **QR code** or use the iOS or Android emulators. When you're done, click **Save** and share the link!

When you're ready to see everything that Expo provides (or if you want to use your own editor) you can **Download** your project and use it with [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation).

All projects created in Snack are publicly available, so you can easily share the link to this project via link, or embed it on a web page with the `<>` button.

If you're having problems, you can tweet to us [@expo](https://twitter.com/expo) or ask in our [forums](https://forums.expo.io/c/snack).

Snack is Open Source. You can find the code on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/expo/snack).

Purpose of the activity

Implementation of a mobile client for a RESTful web service
What is to be done?

This assignment is part of a bigger project and provides these features:

    Display the latest temperature and humidity pair and its timestamp
    Display a list of the latest 10 value pairs
    Bonus: Display the temperature of the last 24 hours/7 days/30 days as chart

It consumes the RESTful web service created in HA Microservice architecture.

It is created as a mobile app using React Native and the Expo SDK. https://snack.expo.dev/ might be used for development and testing, as well as Expo Go to test the application on a mobile device.

Note for the bonus: If the chosen chart library doesn't allow to set x (timestamp) and y (temperature) for every data point, it might be necessary to calculate proper data points for display purposes, e. g. 24 mean values for the latest 24 hours. This calculation should be preferably implemented on the server side. 

The online submission must consist of the following parts :

    Text submission:
        Link to Expo Snack or the GitHub repository containing the source code
    File submission:
        PDF file containing
            Short technical description, used resources (articles, books, tutorials)
            Screenshots showing all features of the final application

The grades are assigned at a joint review by the group and the teacher after submission. The work is to be demonstrated during the review on the mobile phone.
